Update v1.1.0 (2021/06/24)

Bigger update then usual today! A few new features and many changes.

Additons
 - New command: function nolag:cmd/uninstall will remove all traces the datapack even exsisted.
 - New command: function nolag:cmd/clearprojectiles will remove projectiles that load chunks, to improve performance.
 - Created changelog.txt.

Changes
- Help page now shows which page you are on.
- No Lag scoreboards are now more unique, which should lessen issues with not being compatible with other datapacks.
- If auto clear is turned off in the config, No Lag will no longer count time, improving performance.
- Mobs who should not despawn normally (ie: named mobs, mobs with items, etc...)  will no longer die when running function nolag:cmd/killmobs.
- Running function nolag:cmd/freeze_players/off now respects the gamemode the player was in before they got frozen.
- Split the help section from file "README.md" into a new "help.txt". help.txt will list in-game commands.
- Updated the README to be more clear and look cleaner. Now has installation and configuration instructions.
- Default config options for halt command are changed for better general appliance.

Other 
- TPS command temporarily disabled, it was not working properly.
