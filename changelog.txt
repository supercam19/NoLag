Update v1.1.2 (2021/07/07)

Small update, quality of life and performance improvements.

Additions
- Added an automatic debugger that will fix most common issues automatically. This has nearly no impact on performance at all

Changes
- Dropped support for 1.16.5 and below. Added compatibility with 1.17.1.
- The namespace for admin commands is now nl. This means to run the help command you would type /function nl:help. Much more convenient.
- Halt and freeze_players admin commands are now toggle, rather than on/off.
- Optimized most selectors, increasing performance.
- Changed the nl:help command with the new function names.
- Added a link to the "help.txt" on github directly from the help page.
- Optimized timers.

Fixes
- Fixed bug where clearing entities would sometimes not display the number of entities cleared.
- Fixed function nl:itemcount.

Update v1.1.1 (2021/06/25)

Complete overhaul to No Lag's counting system. 
Now more optimized, and will allow more great features in the future, this update is groundwork.

Additions
- New custom No Lag ticks, one tick every 10 seconds.

Changes
- Optimized the performance of Auto Clearing, **theoretically** up too 200X more efficient now.
- Updated config file with notations about No Lags ticks
- Updated README.md to clarify installation instructions

Other
- TPS command still disabled.

Update v1.1.0 (2021/06/24)

Bigger update then usual today! A few new features and many changes.

Additons
 - New command: function nolag:cmd/uninstall will remove all traces the datapack even exsisted.
 - New command: function nolag:cmd/clearprojectiles will remove projectiles that load chunks, to improve performance.
 - Created changelog.txt.

Changes
- Help page now shows which page you are on.
- No Lag scoreboards are now more unique, which should lessen issues with not being compatible with other datapacks.
- If auto clear is turned off in the config, No Lag will no longer count time, improving performance.
- Mobs who should not despawn normally (ie: named mobs, mobs with items, etc...)  will no longer die when running function nolag:cmd/killmobs.
- Running function nolag:cmd/freeze_players/off now respects the gamemode the player was in before they got frozen.
- Split the help section from file "README.md" into a new "help.txt". help.txt will list in-game commands.
- Updated the README to be more clear and look cleaner. Now has installation and configuration instructions.
- Default config options for halt command are changed for better general appliance.

Other 
- TPS command temporarily disabled, it was not working properly.
