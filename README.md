2. Select the world you want to put the datapack on
3. Click edit > Open World Folder
4. Open the "datapacks" folder

To install the datapack, extract the NoLag.zip and place it in your datapacks folder.

To know if its installed correctly, you file path should be /.minecraft/saves/{worldName}/datapacks/NoLag.
Inside this folder you should find a file called "pack.mcmeta" thats how you know it is installed properly.
If there is no "pack.mcmeta" in that path, it is not installed correctly.
