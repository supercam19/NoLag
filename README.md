A datapack for Minecraft 1.17+ to increase performance on your Minecraft server.

  

This is a datapack made by supercam19 to improve server performance. This datapack is different from most other clearlag datapacks because it will not cause any tick lag. If you disable the features in the config, it will not run any commands on its own.

  

This datapack also has a configuration file, located in NoLag/data/nolag_config/functions/config.mcfunction

  

# ðŸ’» Installation

  

--Getting to your datapack folder--

  

Go to the [latest release for NoLag](https://github.com/supercam19/NoLag/releases), and download the NoLag.zip attached to the release.

  

1. Open Minecraft

2. Select the world you want to put the datapack on

3. Click edit > Open World Folder

4. Open the "datapacks" folder

  

To install the datapack, extract the NoLag.zip and place it in your datapacks folder.

  

To know if its installed correctly, you file path should be /.minecraft/saves/{worldName}/datapacks/NoLag.

Inside this folder you should find a file called "pack.mcmeta" thats how you know it is installed properly.

If there is no "pack.mcmeta" in that folder, it is not installed correctly.


  

# ðŸ“ƒ Configuration

  

To configure the datapack, go to you datapacks folder for the world. Then go NoLag/data/nolag_config/functions/config.mcfunction.

  

If you want to also change the what happens when you run function nolag:cmd/clearlag, function nolag:cmd/killmobs or function nolag:cmd/clearprojectiles, go to NoLag/data/nolag_config/tags/entity_types/ and edit the .json file you wish.

# ðŸ›  How to use the datapack
